**CREDIT CARD FRAUD PROTECTION SYSTEM**

**Situation:**
- The code is focused on building a credit card fraud detection model using autoencoders and logistic regression.

**Task:**
- The tasks involve data preprocessing, exploring the dataset, handling imbalanced data, and training a fraud detection model.

**Action:**
1. **Importing Libraries:** Necessary libraries are imported, including pandas, numpy, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
2. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - The dataset is loaded and checked for its dimensions (284,807 rows and 31 columns).
   - The presence of null values is checked (False).
   - Class distribution is visualized using a bar chart, highlighting the imbalance between normal and fraudulent transactions.
   - The number of fraud and non-fraud transactions is printed (492 fraud, 284,315 non-fraud).
   - Descriptive statistics and box plots are used to analyze the distribution of transaction amounts for both classes.
   - Scatter plots show the relationship between time of transaction and transaction amount for fraud and non-fraud cases.
3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - The 'Amount' column is scaled using StandardScaler.
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
4. **Autoencoder Model:**
   - An autoencoder neural network model is built with an encoder-decoder architecture.
   - The model is compiled and fitted using mean squared error loss.
5. **Hidden Representation:**
   - The trained autoencoder is used to obtain the hidden representations of non-fraudulent and fraudulent transactions.
6. **Logistic Regression Model:**
   - The hidden representations are combined, labels are assigned (0 for non-fraudulent, 1 for fraudulent), and the data is split into training and validation sets.
   - Logistic regression is applied to train the model on the training set.
   - The model is evaluated on the validation set using a classification report and accuracy score.

**Result:**
- The logistic regression model achieves a high accuracy score (approximately 95%) in classifying non-fraudulent and fraudulent transactions based on the hidden representations obtained from the autoencoder.

**Summary:**
- The code effectively addresses the challenge of imbalanced data in credit card fraud detection using a combination of autoencoder for feature learning and logistic regression for classification. The model shows promising results in identifying fraudulent transactions.
